## Overview

A single HTTP endpoint accepts tracking data (steps, weight, or both) for a given date and client. External systems (wearables, automation tools) use this endpoint via an API key to submit readings without human interaction.

---

## Requirements

### REQ-UTA-01: Single Endpoint Contract

The system SHALL expose `POST /api/clients/[clientId]/tracking` that accepts a tracking payload for a specific date.

**Request shape**:

| Field | Type | Required | Constraints |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `date` | ISO 8601 date string (`YYYY-MM-DD`) | YES | Must not be a future date |
| `steps` | integer | NO (at least one of steps/weight required) | 0–100,000 |
| `weight` | number | NO (at least one of steps/weight required) | 0.1–500 |

**Request headers**:

| Header | Required | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `x-api-key` | YES | Client-scoped API key |

**Success response** (`200 OK`):

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "entry": {
    "date": "2026-04-19",
    "steps": 5000,
    "weight": 80.0
  }
}
```

Fields `steps` and `weight` are omitted from the response if they were not included in the request.

#### Scenario: Valid request with both steps and weight
- **GIVEN** a valid API key and body `{ "date": "2026-04-19", "steps": 5000, "weight": 80 }`
- **WHEN** a POST is made to `/api/clients/[clientId]/tracking`
- **THEN** the system returns `200 OK` with `{ "success": true, "entry": { "date": "2026-04-19", "steps": 5000, "weight": 80 } }`

#### Scenario: Valid request with steps only
- **GIVEN** a valid API key and body `{ "date": "2026-04-19", "steps": 8000 }`
- **WHEN** a POST is made to the endpoint
- **THEN** the system returns `200 OK` with `{ "success": true, "entry": { "date": "2026-04-19", "steps": 8000 } }`

#### Scenario: Valid request with weight only
- **GIVEN** a valid API key and body `{ "date": "2026-04-19", "weight": 75.5 }`
- **WHEN** a POST is made to the endpoint
- **THEN** the system returns `200 OK` with `{ "success": true, "entry": { "date": "2026-04-19", "weight": 75.5 } }`

---

### REQ-UTA-02: Authentication

The system SHALL reject requests that do not carry a valid `x-api-key` header matching the target client.

| Condition | HTTP Status | Response body |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| Missing `x-api-key` header | `401 Unauthorized` | `{ "error": "Missing API key" }` |
| API key present but invalid or expired | `401 Unauthorized` | `{ "error": "Invalid API key" }` |
| API key belongs to a different client | `403 Forbidden` | `{ "error": "Forbidden" }` |

#### Scenario: Request with no API key
- **GIVEN** a POST with no `x-api-key` header
- **WHEN** the request reaches the endpoint
- **THEN** the system returns `401` with `{ "error": "Missing API key" }` and no data is written

#### Scenario: Request with an invalid API key
- **GIVEN** a POST with `x-api-key: bad-key-value`
- **WHEN** the request reaches the endpoint
- **THEN** the system returns `401` with `{ "error": "Invalid API key" }` and no data is written

#### Scenario: API key belongs to a different client
- **GIVEN** a valid API key for client B, but the URL references client A's ID
- **WHEN** the request reaches the endpoint
- **THEN** the system returns `403 Forbidden` and no data is written

---

### REQ-UTA-03: Input Validation

The system SHALL validate the request body and return structured errors for any violations.

| Violation | HTTP Status | Error message |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| Both `steps` and `weight` absent | `400 Bad Request` | `"At least one of 'steps' or 'weight' is required"` |
| `date` missing or invalid format | `400 Bad Request` | `"Invalid or missing date"` |
| `date` is a future date | `400 Bad Request` | `"Date cannot be in the future"` |
| `steps` out of range (< 0 or > 100,000) | `400 Bad Request` | `"Steps must be between 0 and 100000"` |
| `weight` out of range (< 0.1 or > 500) | `400 Bad Request` | `"Weight must be between 0.1 and 500"` |

Error response shape:
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "<message from table above>"
}
```

#### Scenario: Body with neither steps nor weight
- **GIVEN** a valid API key and body `{ "date": "2026-04-19" }`
- **WHEN** a POST is made to the endpoint
- **THEN** the system returns `400` with `{ "success": false, "error": "At least one of 'steps' or 'weight' is required" }`

#### Scenario: Future date rejected
- **GIVEN** a valid API key and body `{ "date": "2099-01-01", "steps": 1000 }`
- **WHEN** a POST is made to the endpoint
- **THEN** the system returns `400` with `{ "success": false, "error": "Date cannot be in the future" }`

#### Scenario: Weight out of range
- **GIVEN** a valid API key and body `{ "date": "2026-04-19", "weight": 600 }`
- **WHEN** a POST is made to the endpoint
- **THEN** the system returns `400` with `{ "success": false, "error": "Weight must be between 0.1 and 500" }`

---

### REQ-UTA-04: Data Dispatch

The system SHALL persist tracking data by dispatching to the appropriate domain actions based on which fields are present in the request.

| Fields present | Actions called |
|----------------|---------------|
| `steps` only | `addDailyStep(clientId, date, steps)` |
| `weight` only | `addDailyWeight(clientId, date, weight)` |
| `steps` + `weight` | Both `addDailyStep` AND `addDailyWeight` — treated atomically (both succeed or neither persists) |

#### Scenario: Both steps and weight dispatched atomically
- **GIVEN** a valid request body `{ "date": "2026-04-19", "steps": 5000, "weight": 80 }`
- **WHEN** the endpoint processes the request
- **THEN** both a step entry and a weight entry are recorded for the same date, and if either persistence call fails, neither is committed

#### Scenario: Steps-only dispatch
- **GIVEN** a valid request body `{ "date": "2026-04-19", "steps": 7500 }`
- **WHEN** the endpoint processes the request
- **THEN** only a step entry is recorded; no weight record is created or modified

#### Scenario: Weight-only dispatch
- **GIVEN** a valid request body `{ "date": "2026-04-19", "weight": 79.2 }`
- **WHEN** the endpoint processes the request
- **THEN** only a weight entry is recorded; no step record is created or modified

## Out of Scope

- Batch submission of multiple dates in a single request (v1: one date per call)
- API key management UI (keys issued out-of-band in v1)
- Rate limiting (infrastructure concern, not specified here)
- DELETE or GET operations on tracked data via this endpoint
