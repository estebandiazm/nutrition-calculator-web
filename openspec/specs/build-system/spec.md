# build-system Specification

## Purpose
TBD - created by archiving change clean-vite-react-router. Update Purpose after archive.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Next.js as Sole Build System
The project SHALL use Next.js App Router as the only build and routing system. No alternative bundler (Vite) or client-side router (react-router-dom) configuration SHALL exist in the project.

#### Scenario: Developer runs the development server
- **WHEN** a developer runs `npm run dev`
- **THEN** the Next.js development server MUST start without errors
- **AND** no Vite configuration files (`vite.config.ts`, `index.html`) SHALL exist in the project root

#### Scenario: Developer builds for production
- **WHEN** a developer runs `npm run build`
- **THEN** the Next.js production build MUST complete successfully
- **AND** the build output MUST be in `.next/` (not `dist/`)

#### Scenario: No legacy routing dependencies installed
- **WHEN** a developer inspects `package.json` dependencies
- **THEN** `react-router-dom`, `history`, and `@vitejs/plugin-react` MUST NOT be present
- **AND** no source file SHALL import from `react-router-dom` or `vite`

### Requirement: Clean Git Repository
The Git repository SHALL NOT track build artifacts, caches, or files that are environment-specific and auto-generated.

#### Scenario: Build artifacts are gitignored
- **WHEN** a developer runs `npm run build` or `tsc`
- **THEN** generated files (`tsconfig.tsbuildinfo`, `.next/`, `dist/`) MUST NOT appear in `git status` as untracked or modified

#### Scenario: Lock files are gitignored
- **WHEN** a developer runs `npm install`
- **THEN** `package-lock.json` MUST NOT appear in `git status` as a changed file

### Requirement: No Known Critical or High Vulnerabilities from Legacy Dependencies
The project SHALL NOT contain dependencies with known CRITICAL or HIGH severity vulnerabilities that originate from removed legacy tools (Vite, react-router).

#### Scenario: npm audit after cleanup
- **WHEN** a developer runs `npm audit`
- **THEN** no CRITICAL or HIGH vulnerabilities SHALL originate from Vite, react-router, or their transitive dependencies
